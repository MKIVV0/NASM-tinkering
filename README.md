# NASM-tinkering
The purpose of learning an assembly-like language like ASM x86 (using NASM assembler in this case) is to acquire a 
deeper understanding of how programs work at a lower level, in activities like register management, system call invocations and, 
in general, to have a rawer interaction with the machine.
All of the reasons above are derived from a general interest in the system security field, where it is better to have a certain 
assembly knowledge (e.g: rootkits, general malware analysis, reverse engineering, etc.).
